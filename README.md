# AlwaysOnline

Always stay online even when away - Built for Discord.



The open door policy, where everyone is welcome to come talk, is a common theme. The same thing can translate over to the remote working world where, instead of the ugly "DoNotDisturb", which feels unwelcoming, you can always stay online even when idle or not around. This can give the presence of the "always open door policy", whilst not letting people track your activity.
